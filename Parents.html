    <p>Mother: Cynthia C. Desoloc <br> Father: Audrey P. Desoloc <br><br>Parents are God-given precious gifts for children. Parents are both Mother and Father who have brought us to this world and nurture us with eternal affection and love since childhood. Parents take care, advice, and teach us through our journey as infants, children, teenagers, and at the early stages of Adulthood.

Even if they face trouble and live in scarcity, they will never let us face any tough situations. We remain indebted to our parents, and we must be with them and take care of them during their need for time.

Parents work hard and make sacrifices to ensure we get all the necessary resources that aid us in our overall development, such as mental, physical, financial, social, and educational. We should never denounce the role and value of parents in our life.</p>
